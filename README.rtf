\f0\fs24 \cf0 I started my javascript file by establishing the different variables/characters the password generator can use. I then made the different prompts asking the user which characters they would like to be included in their password and the length of the password. If no character types are selected, there is a prompt telling the user they must select at least one character type. I had trouble making the passwords actually generate on the page after the prompts section.}
